# Worms-life-simulator

School project made in C++, project is simulation of worms and there are some rules about them:

- Green square means food, and red square means empty square,
- every worm, needs to eat food to don't die,
- every worm that has maximum length, can reproduce every reproducing cycle,
- every game tick, worms move in random direction,
- you can adjust every parameter in simulation (worm average lifespan, worm maximum length)
